A digital "Truth or Drink" game with actual interesting uncomfortable questions. Made because most online versions are either too soft or just badly written.

### Why this exists
- Most truth-or-dare games online have terrible questions ("What's your favorite color?" isn't a truth question)  
- Wanted something that actually makes people uncomfortable (in a fun way)  

### What's different
- **300+ questions** curated to remove boring and childish questions from Internet 
- **Three player modes**:
  - *Couple*: For intimate one-on-one play (e.g. *"What first attracted you to me?"*)
  - *Party*: For group settings (e.g. *"Who in this room do you think..."*)
  - *Everyone*: General questions suitable for any context
- **Three question categories**:
  - *Personal*: Deep, biographical questions (e.g. *"What was your worst birthday and why?"*)
  - *Sex*: Intimate and revealing questions (e.g. *"Whatâ€™s the most unusual place on your body that you like to be touched?"*)
  - *Trash*: Morally ambiguous dilemmas with no right answers and very uncomfortable questions (e.g. *"Would you rather swap lives with a homeless person or spend a year in prison?"*)
- **Syncs in real-time** - start a session and others can join via 4-letter code  
- **Completely Free** - no need to download and pay for question packs

### How it's built
- HTML/CSS/JS frontend  
- Supabase for the database (questions + sessions)  
- WebSockets for real-time sync  
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
